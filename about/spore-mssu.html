<h1>Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR)</h1>
<p>The CHBMR is part of a <strong>Maritime SPOR SUPPORT Unit (MSSU)</strong>, a specialized, multidisciplinary research service centre that aims to provide the necessary and often highly specialized methodological expertise to those engaged in patient-orientated research. The goal of the MSSU is to efficiently use scarce resources so that stakeholders can better address critical health issues in patient-orientated and health services research.</p>
<p>Patient-orientated research refers to a continuum of research, from initial studies in humans to comparative effectiveness and outcomes research, and the integration of this research into a health care system and clinical practice. The goal of patient orientated research is to better ensure the translation of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the point of care, as well as help the Maritime provinces meet the challenges of delivering high-quality, cost-effective health care.</p>
<p>The Unit will provide a suite of services including strategic and technical expertise in observational and experimental research, consultancy services, a training facility and a common data platform that will facilitate evaluative and interventional studies designed to improve the health of people in the Maritime Provinces.</p>

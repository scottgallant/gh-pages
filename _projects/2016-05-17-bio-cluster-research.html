<h1>Bio-Cluster Research</h1><p>
</p><p>The CHBMR&nbsp; conducted studies on cluster dynamics and sustainability for the Prince Edward Island (PEI) life sciences and biotechnology cluster in collaboration with the PEI BioAlliance, Dr. Steven Casper, Keck Graduate Institute, California, and Diane Alleva CÃ ceres, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.&nbsp;Research agendas were matched with policy questions in collaboration with stakeholders.</p>
<p>The comprehensive survey was conducted in 2009 and again in 2013. Our goal is to track cluster growth over time, examining areas such as human resources, external resources, governance, networks, and financing. These five areas help depict the sustainability and stage of the biotechnology cluster in PEI.</p><ul><li>Link to results here?</li></ul><h1>Skills PEI Research</h1>
<p>The CHBMR conducted studies for <a href="http://www.skillspei.com/">Skills PEI</a> to research the biotechnology industry workforce on Prince Edward Island (PEI). Three projects were completed:</p>
<p>Project 1 was an economic base analysis to study the health of the industry.</p>
<p>Project 2 investigated the&nbsp;awareness of available careers in the field through an environmental scan, capturing all the educational and training programs in the Life Sciences and Biotechnology educational sector.</p>
<p>Project 3 investigated the skills developed through the available training programs compared to the skills required for positions in the industry, using definitions from the National Occupational Classification Matrix of skill types and levels.</p>
<p>The projects address two major questions of the Life Sciences and Biotechnology sector in the province:</p>
<ol><li> How healthy is the industry?</li><li>How healthy is the workforce pipeline?</li></ol><ul><li>Link to results here?</li></ul><h1>Educational Initiatives Research</h1>
<p>The shortage of skilled or experienced workers in the biotechnology industry is the most significant HR challenge. In 2011, BioTalent Canada remarked that over 35% of Canadian biotechnology companies in Canada lacked the skill set they required. If Prince Edward Island (PEI) is to sustain its biotechnology cluster, clearly the lack of qualified and skilled personnel needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>To tackle this challenge, there needs to be opportunity to coordinate outreach-oriented initiatives that aim to increase interest in and knowledge of the industry. As an important step, we surveyed various initiatives and found there are many different programs on PEI that are already working to address the HR challenge.</p><ul><li>Link to results here?</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p>

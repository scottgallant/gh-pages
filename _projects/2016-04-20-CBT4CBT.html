<p>In 2014 the CHBMR entered into a collaboration with Dr. Kathleen Carroll from Yale University to bring her innovative new treatment program ‘Computer-Based Training for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy’(CBT4CBT) to Canada for the first time.</p>
<p>CBT4CBT is an add-on program for individuals struggling with drug and alcohol abuse. The program has demonstrated excellent success in its initial clinical trials. This innovative computer program trains the recipient in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, an empirically validated treatment, and is currently being rolled out in the United States.</p>
<p>The CHBMR is conducting clinical trials in Prince Edward Island to test the efficacy and effectiveness of CBT4CBT within rural Canadian populations. The CHBMR intends to evaluate and modify CBT4CBT for specific Canadian populations before expanding the program to other parts of Canada.</p>

<h1>What is CBT4CBT?</h1>
<p>CBT4CBT stands for Computer-Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. It is a new, web-based program aimed at helping people to reduce or stop use of drugs and/or alcohol when used as part of comprehensive treatment programs that are delivered by healthcare professionals. This is the first time it’s being offered in Canada.</p>
<p>CBT4CBT is being offered at select sites in Prince Edward Island in coordination with trained Counsellors. If you’re interested in trying this new web-based program, please call Cheryl at 902-620-5204 or fill out the Contact Us form on this page to ask questions or to sign up.</p>

<h1>Does CBT4CBT work?</h1>
<p>CBT4CBT&nbsp;has been shown to be effective in two independent clinical trials (see reference #1, #2 and #3 in the <a href="http://www.cbt4cbt.com/references/">reference list</a>), when used as part of a professionally administered substance abuse treatment program. Additional trials are ongoing (see <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct01615497">here</a>, <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02043210++&Search=Search">here</a>, <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT01442597&Search=Search">here </a>and <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT00809835&Search=Search">here</a>), which are designed to expand the use of CBT4CBT. CBT4CBT has also been shown to be a cost-effective treatment in a peer-reviewed study (see reference #6 in the <a href="http://www.cbt4cbt.com/references/">reference list</a>).</p>

<h1>Breast Cancer Screening Study
</h1>
<p>Breast cancer screening has been available in PEI since 1987 and a structured program of recruiting women for breast cancer screening began in 1998. The goal of the program is to diagnose breast cancer at an early stage to ultimately improve patient outcomes.</p>
<p>The PEI CancerTrends2009 report found PEI women had similar breast cancer rates to Canadian women but that the long-term survival of women with breast cancer in PEI is significantly lower than the Canadian rate. This study seeks to understand why mortality from breast cancer is higher for PEI women.</p>

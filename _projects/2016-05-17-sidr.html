<h1>Data Harmonization</h1>
<p>Data Harmonization combines information from different sources and assembles them together to provide users with a unified view of these data sets. This allows the timely and accurate extraction of information.</p>
<p>The CHBMR is working to begin linking Data Repositories for existing administrative health databases with patient and treatment registries. This will transform them into accessible and more user friendly sources for research evaluation across the continuum of health care. Through this process, we are also creating standardized analytic data sets and protocols for utilizing data to facilitate collaboration.</p>
